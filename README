Netrace is a network packet trace reader library for use with network
simulators. It reads packets from tracefiles of a standardized, flexible
file format. This is a Python implementation of parts of the original
netrace as created by Joel Hestness of University of Texas in Austin.
For the original, see https://github.com/booksim/netrace and
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~netrace/

Currently the trace viewer of the original has been mostly replicated.

To run it, use `./netrace.py <tracefile>`. Uncompressed, gzip and bz2
files are all supported and should be autodetected provided python's
magic library is able to determine the right MIME type.

The API is a WIP and this README will be updated in due course (assuming
the author manages to make use of this Python port).
